Bootstrap Review Exercise 1   solution http://pastebin.com/mLzPyma8
===========================   until about 2:30 ish
Open the template and save as review1.html
Create two <div> blocks divided like this: 
For md and lg use 4/12 and 8/12 then for sm and xs use 12/12 and 12/12 

Use <div class="panel panel-info"><div class="panel-heading"> and <div class="panel-body">
within in each column (i.e. one on the left one on the right)

Build a form in the left panel and render three product images in the right column
In the form ask for name and email and render the form fields horizontally or vertically depending on space. Apply rounded corners to each of the three images

Use <div class="page-header"> at the top and <div class="page-footer"> at the bottom with sample content (e.g. titles and legal content). You may also need to use class=container

Optional
--------
Explore <span class="input-group-addon glyphicon glyph-iconuser"> immediately before the user name form field
Also try <span class="input-group-addon">@</span> immediately before the email form field
Put an icon on the form submit button
