Bootstrap Review Exercise 2   see http://pastebin.com/eLrjnNyq
===========================    http://pastebin.com/HH7ADPWR
 
Build a page containing three collapsible accordion sections for
- a drop-down of category choices
- a carousel of images
- a panel containing a table listing shopping cart items
Provide a top-level navbar including links to basic.html and authenticate.html
Use grid layout as required

Optional
========
Opening/closing an accordion section should change the label 'open' to 'close'
Populate the drop-down categories via a JavaScript object
Write a simple jQuery AJAX-call to load photos.json then use the images in the carousel (use 'desc' as the tooltip content)
Add photos to an array (the cart) and show these dynamically in the table
